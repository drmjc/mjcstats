mjcstats
========

An R package of simple statistics code.

Description
===========
My general statistics library, containing code for genetic linkage scans, correlation analyses, additional corrections for multiple hypothesis testing.

Note most of this code dates from 2004-2008, so may be a little out of date. 

Warning, almost no unit tests! It wasn't particularly advanced stuff though, and rarely breaks in routine use.

Installation
============

    library(devtools)
    install_github("mjcstats", "drmjc")
